# Python-Automated-CSV-Renaming-and-Word-Document-Filling-Script
As asked in my Work with their directives , this repository contains Python scripts designed to automate the renaming of CSV files and the filling of Word documents from templates. These tools streamline repetitive tasks by dynamically merging data with predefined documents, improving efficiency.

## Features
- **Automatic CSV Renaming**: The script allows batch renaming of CSV files based on specified patterns or rules given by my company.
- **Word Document Auto-filling**: Data extracted from CSV files is inserted into predefined Word document templates, generating completed documents with minimal manual effort.
- **Batch Processing**: The scripts can process multiple CSV files in one go, enhancing productivity and saving time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries: 
  - `pandas` for handling CSV data
  - `docx` for working with Word documents (via `python-docx`)
  - `docx2pdf` for converting Word documents to PDF
  - `openpyxl` for reading and writing Excel files
  - `docxtpl` for templating Word documents
  - `os` for file management
  - `tkinter` (optional, for graphical user interface)
  - `pathlib` for file path manipulations


This setup provides a clear structure for anyone who wants to use or contribute to project. Let me know if you need any more changes!
